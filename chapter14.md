## Chapter 14 A Brief Survey Of The Linux Desktop

### Introduction
***
The Desktop environment for Linux Machines is one of the most customizable features. You have many different 
environemnt to choose from. There are no hierarchy of layers involved in creating a desktop structure. 
Some components however do share common building blocks (in particular, libraries for graphical toolkits). 
In order to work together all applications need to have something in common
at the core of nearly everything on most Linux desktops is the X (X Window System) server. 
X is what manages everything or on the desktop, from rendering windows to configuring displays to handling 
input from devices such as keybards and mice. You will not easily find a replacement for the X windows.
The X-clint programs handle the user interface, so X doesnt dictate the way anything should act or appear.
