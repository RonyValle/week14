## Chapter 14 A Brief Survey Of The Linux Desktop

### Introduction
***
The Desktop environment for Linux Machines is one of the most customizable features. You have many different
environment to choose from. There are no hierarchy of layers involved in creating a desktop structure.
Some components however do share common building blocks (in particular, libraries for graphical toolkits).
In order to work together all applications need to have something in common
at the core of nearly everything on most Linux desktops is the X (X Window System) server.
X is what manages everything or on the desktop, from rendering windows to configuring displays to handling
input from devices such as keyboards and mice. You will not easily find a replacement for the X windows.
The X-clint programs handle the user interface, so X doesn't dictate the way anything should act or appear.
Basic X client applications make connections to the X server and ask to draw windows. The X server response by figuring out
where to place the windows and renders them. The X server also channels input back to the applications when appropriate.</br>
*The window manager* is perhaps the most important client service application because it figures out how to arrange on screen
and provides interactive decorations like title bars that allow the user to move and minimize windows. </br>
*widgets* are are certain common elements such as buttons and menus that desktop applications include. To speed up development and
provide a common look, programmers use graphical *toolkits* to provide the elements mentioned before. Toolkids typically consist of
share libraries. Toolkits and other libraries are bundled into larger packages called *desktop environments* GNOME, KDE, Unity, and Xfce are some common Linux desktop environments.
The most common way to start X is with a window display manager, a program that starts the server and puts a login box on your screen. When you log in, the display manager starts a set of client, such as window manager and file manage. Starting X by itself will give you a blank screen.
A way to explore the X window is to run the command `xwininfo` this command asks you to "Please select the window about which you
would like information by clicking the mouse in that window" this command prints some information such as its location and size.
The command `xev` lets you experiment with events. A new window is open that you can mouse into, click and type. Output is generated by `xev` describing the X events that it receives from the server.
The X server uses the X Input Extension to manage input from many different devices. In order to use multiple input devices
simultaneously, the X Input Extension creates a "virtual core" device that funnels device input to the X server.
The X Window System was first developed in the 1980s. The X Window System is not suitable for environments such as smartphones
and tablets due to its poor performance and gigantic footprint.
