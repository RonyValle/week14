In the group meeting we came up with some task that still need to be done. Here they are:
1. Get documentation from Alex about how he created the web server.
2. A website has now been deploy in soopsplash.csci4161 you can see it here:
   <https://sootsplash.csci2461.com/index.html>  Check it out!
3. Every team has a page in the website that they can utilize. We need to create and document steps 
   as to how they can make changes. Share this feature with the class on Wednesday. share links about 
   html in case people don't know how to.
4. create a nice home page Background that portraits the class in general not just our group.
5. For our webpage we want to create bios of all the team members that icludes a picture and a link to  
   their particular github account profile. we will also create a discription of our project that also links to
   the documentation found on git hub.
